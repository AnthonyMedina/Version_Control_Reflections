1. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working from several computers, either from work and home, or when several different users
are contributing to a repository, it would be useful to create a remote repository.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might always want to pull changes manually as this gives me more control over
the local code. If I was part way through resolving a bug or adding a feature
locally, I would want to complete it before pulling a change somebody else had
made.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

6. When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
